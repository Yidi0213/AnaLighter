Highlighter enables web users to select a text paragraph and view key 
phrases in that paragraph. It utilizes Natural Language Understanding from
Microsoft's Azure to analyze text and select key phrases. After the user selects 
a paragraph, the key phrases from that paragraph as well as their occurrences
throughout the entire text will be highlighted.

One of our goals with Highlighter is to assist web users to process information

a long document. Highlighter utilizes a simple interface which is easily accessible.
All you need to do is to select a paragraph you wish to read, and Highlighter will
highlight key phrases for you. Occurrences of the key phrases in the 
entire text will also be highlighted, showing the relationship between the selected
paragraph and the entire document.
