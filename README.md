## Inspiration
Have you ever run into a long document and had no idea where to start reading? Have you had a hard time extracting key information from a research paper? Have you ever had trouble looking for answers to your questions on a web page? Maybe you want something magical that can extract key information for you? We are making one for you! With the help of robust AI service provided by IBM Watson, we built our Analytic Highlighter, an intelligent Chrome extension, to make your dream come true. Serving as your personal "secretary", it highlights key phrases to enhance your web browsing experience and save your invaluable time to focus on important things that you care. 

## What it does
When you turn on the Analytic Highlighter, it will select the whole content in the webpage as default. It then utilizes Natural Language Understanding API from IBM to analyze the content and output key phrases in the content, which will be highlighted with a front end library. Users can also select a paragraph and press shift to highlight the key phrases appeared in that paragraph throughout the whole webpage.

## Acknowledgement
We came up with the idea at HackRice 9. We built a very simple version at that time (only support single-color highlighting). We ended up winning actually. Here is the [link](https://devpost.com/software/analighter) to our project. <br/>
To make our extension work, we use IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API [link](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding) to extract key words and mark.js [link](https://markjs.io/) to highlight key words.
