## Inspiration
Have you ever run into a long document and had no idea where to start reading? Have you had a hard time extracting key information from a research paper? Have you ever had trouble looking for answers to your questions on a web page? Maybe you want your computer to analyze the whole passage beforehand and extract key information for you? Unfortunately, there doesn't exist any apps or chrome extensions with this function. Hence, we are ready to be the pioneer! With the help of machine learning, we built AnaLighter, an intelligent Chrome extension, to make your dream come true. Serving as your personal "secretary", it highlights key phrases to enhance your web browsing experience and save your invaluable time. 

## What it does
When a web page is loaded, AnaLighter extracts all its text contents. It then utilizes Natural Language Understanding API from IBM to analyze the content and select its key phrases. Users can also specify the paragraph they want to focus on. After users select a paragraph, press shift, the key phrases from that paragraph, as well as their occurrences throughout the entire text, will be highlighted.
